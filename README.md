# LetsMakeADynamicQuery

## Demonstration Program
  [Web Application](https://github.com/210426-java-react-enterprise/Team-B_p1_WebApp)

## Overview

  This application will take advantage of Java's reflection library along with annotations to build prepared statements for persisting
  to PostgreSQL database.

  There are two main objects within...

## PostgresQueryBuilder

  This object will require a Connection object to be instantiated.

  Once instantiated it has a few public facing methods based on query types that only require a POJO to be passed to it...

### PostgresQueryBuilder Functions

  * insert (This will take in a POJO with a blank ID and persist it assuming the database will generate an ID)
  * insertWithPK (This will take in a POJO with an existing ID and persist it to the database with the given ID)
  * insertAndGetId (Much like the insert method but will return the databases generated ID upon completion)
  * update (Will take a POJO with an ID and update the existing persistent entry based on the changes)
  * delete (Will take a POJO with an ID and delete the database entry by ID)
  * selectByPrimaryKey (Will take in an uncomplete POJO only containing and ID and return a Map for use with the GenericObjectMaker)
  * loginByUsername (For used with authenticatin based systems, will check the databse for a username and password combination and 
                     return a map for the GenericObjectMaker to create a user POJO as defined by the parent application)
  * loginByEmail (Same as above but instead of username it will utilize an email address)
  * loginByUsernamePgCrypt (Much like the above but utilizes PostgreSQL's pgCrypt library for more secure authentication using passwords)
  * loginByEmailPgCrypt (Much like the above but utilizes PostgreSQL's pgCrypt library for more secure authentication using passwords)
  * getUsername (Will take in an uncomplete POJO only containing and ID and return an associated username)
  * getEmail (Will take in an uncomplete POJO only containing and ID and return an associated email)

## GenericObjectMaker

  This object requires no arguments to make and will build a POJO based on a list of one or more maps.

### GenericObjectMaker Functions

  * buildObject (Takes in a map and will return the first object contained as a fully completed POJO)
  * buildObjects (Takes in a map and will return a list of all objects contained as fully completed POJOs)
